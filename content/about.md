I'm a software engineer, *nix sysadmin, and operations guy living in the Black Hills of South Dakota. I'm currently employed as Lead Platform Engineer for the Digital Operations Group at SRAM. I'm responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure supporting a variety of digital initiatives. This includes web service development in Python, a bit of embedded C, and managing our services on AWS. CI, log aggregation, metric collection, monitoring, security, and alerting are all part of the job.

In the past I've done telecommunications research and development for a mid-sized ISP and helped build a startup offering an innovative product for lawyers and law students
