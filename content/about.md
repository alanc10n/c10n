I'm a software engineer, *nix sysadmin, and operations guy living in the Black Hills of South Dakota. I'm currently employed as a Staff Software Engineer for the Digital Product Group at [SRAM](https://www.sram.com). I'm responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure supporting a variety of digital initiatives. This includes web service development in Python, a bit of embedded C, and managing our services on AWS. CI, deployment, log aggregation, metric collection, monitoring, security, and alerting are all part of the job. The posts on this site are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of SRAM.

In the past I've done telecommunications research and development for a mid-sized ISP and helped build a startup focusing on automatically managing citations, tables of authorities, etc. in legal briefs and memoranda. I've done some teaching and delivered enough pizza to feed a small country.
