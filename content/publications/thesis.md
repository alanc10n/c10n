My master's thesis, an investigation of an AI technique called Grammatical Evolution. The technique combines an ordered list of integers as the genome with a problem-specific grammar. A mapping process uses these two components to produce candidates in the desired solution space. In simple terms, GE attempts to evolve solutions to problems using standard Genetic Algorithms while using domain knowledge to limit the search space.
